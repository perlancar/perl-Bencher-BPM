# ABSTRACT: Simple script to run benchmark scenario with Benchmark.pm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution includes the script L<bencher-bpm> to run benchmark scenario
with L<Benchmark> (Benchmark.pm). It lacks L<bencher> features like filtering
participants/datasets/modules, listing participants/datasets or other actions.
But it is small and does not have any non-core dependency.
